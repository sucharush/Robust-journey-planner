# Robust Journey Planner
**Summary:** This is a robust journey planner for public transport that works across different regions of Switzerland. A user can simply select arrival & departure stops, time of departure, preferred time of arrival, and a minimal level of confidence at which the user wants a journey to succeed. After that, the model will crunch a large amount of data and predict a set of routes for a user to choose from.

## How-to
### Generating the Dataset
Settle the dataset by executing the file `./data_generation.py`. Select the area by changing the `object_id` at the top of the file.
```shell
python data_generation.py
```
**Note:** The current `./data` folder contains the dataset generated by setting `object_id = 1` (Lausanne area), please wait until the file finishes running to refresh the dataset whenever you change this parameter.

### Running the Interactive Planner
1. Open `./visualization.ipynb` and run all code cells. An interface with an input form will appear.

**Note:** For the stops and times, please type from the keyboard and select the suggested option, as using the dropdown alone may not display fully.

2. Select your preferred inputs, click on `Find Routes` and wait until the routes pop up.

**Note:** The display on the map might be corrupted due to incomplete stop information in the dataset. Please refer to the printed path details for complete information.

Select a path you like the most and enjoy your trip!

## Implementation details
### Datasets
The following datasets are created in `data_generation.py`:
- `sbb_real_stop_times.parquet`: the SBB istdaten dataset that is filtered to only contain entries from the last week of January. Only one week of data was used in order to simplify model building and execution. One can extend the dates to achieve more accurate historical statistics.
- `sbb_timetable_stop_times.parquet`: a timetable that contains all planned arrival and departure times for different trips in a stop. Additional columns were included to indicate the weekdays for which the timetable entry holds. 
- `stops.csv`: all stop names in the selected region.
- `stop_to_stop.csv`: pairs of stops that are within 500m of each other.

### Routing algorithm

#### Transport network
The TransportNetwork class constructs a transport network graph from the provided timetable, stop-to-stop distances, and stop data. Here’s a structured explanation of how the class operates:

#### Finding the shortest route: Dijkstra + Yen's
Dijkstra's algorithm implemented in `route_planning.py` is designed to find the shortest travel time route from a departure stop to a destination stop within a given graph. The graph represents a network of transportation routes, where nodes are stops and edges are the travel connections between them. After that, Yen's K-Shortest Paths (KSP) algorithm is used to find multiple (K) shortest paths from a departure stop to a destination stop within a given graph by iteratively deviating from the best-known path. 

#### Delay model

The `delay model` utilizes the statistical model to estimate the reliability of reaching a destination on time.
